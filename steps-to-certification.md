# Steps to Certification

**Newcomer:** You are absolutely new to Drupal and Acquia products

**Intermediate**: You have Drupal development experience, but are new to the Acquia platform

**Advanced:** You have Drupal development and ACSF experience, and wish to get certified.

## ~~Take Acquia Academy 100 Level Courses~~

~~As a newcomer to the Acquia platform, take the introductory course in Acquia Academy. This will start you on your journey to certification.~~

* ~~NO COURSES ARE PUBLIC~~

You can access this and other courses for free at \[training.acquia.com\]\([https://training.acquia.com/\](https://training.acquia.com/%29\): and review them as many times as you like. Many Acquia Academy courses are available, and if you are in an Acquia enablement or training program, you have been assigned the courses you most require to obtain an initial certification.

Courses follow a model of 100-level for introductory material, 200-level for application of the concepts, 300-level for advanced concepts, and 400-level for solution architecture.

## Read Product Documentation

Reading the product documentation for [Acquia Cloud Site Factory](https://docs.acquia.com/site-factory) is the best way to gain a clear understanding of the product, its features and functions, and related best practices. In particular, focus on the following areas:

* **&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ACSF EXPERT \_ ADD MOST IMPORTANT LINKS FROM DOCS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;**

## Gain Practical Experience

Reviewing this study guide alone will not prepare you to pass the certification exam. You need to have some real-life, practical experience to attempt the exam. For this purpose, we recommend that you gain practical experience by working with at least 2-3 real life projects.

_**If you are not working on active projects using Acquia Cloud Site Factory, you can use Acquia's&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;**_

## Perform Self Assessment

Once you decide to take the exam, we recommend that you study the \[domains and topics\]\(/exam-domains.md\) covered by the exam and their relative weightings. You should also perform a \[self assessment\]\(/self-assessment.md\) of your own areas of strength and weakness vis-a-vis the domains and topics covered by the exam blueprint. This is a recommended starting point for experienced Drupal 8 Developers.

## Use Labs and Study Guide

Based on your self assessment, you may need to gain knowledge and experience in some domains or topics. The best way to learn is by working or experimenting with the tools. Follow the suggestions given for preparation in the \[Preparation\]\(/preparation.md\) section and refer to the external resources given in the \[Study Guide\]\(/study-guide.md\) section.
